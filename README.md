# Angular Spotify

A simple Spotify client built with Angular, Nx workspace, ngrx, TailwindCSS and ng-zorro.

**Spotify premium** is required for the Web Playback SDK to play music. If you are using a free account, you can still browse the app, but it couldn't play the music.

## High-level design

### Principles

All components are following:

- OnPush Change Detection and async pipes: all components use observable and async pipe for rendering data without any single manual subscribe.
- SCAMs (single component Angular modules) for tree-shakable components, meaning each component will have a respective module. For example, a RegisterComponent will have a corresponding RegisterModule.
- Mostly, everything will stay in the `libs` folder. New modules, new models, new configurations, new components etc... are in libs. libs should be separated into different directories based on existing apps.

### Structure

```

### Authentication Flow

This project follows `Implicit Grant Flow` that Spotify recommended for client-side only applications and does not involve secret keys. The issued access tokens are short-lived, and there are no refresh tokens to extend them when they expire.

View the [Spotify Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)

- Upon opening Angular Spotify, it will redirect you to Spotify to get access to your data. Angular Spotify only uses the data purely for displaying on the UI.
- Angular Spotify only keeps the access token in the browser memory without even storing it into browser local storage. If you do a hard refresh on the browser, it will ask for a new access token from Spotify. One access token is only valid for **one hour**.

### Dependency Graph

Nx provides an [dependency graph][dep-graph-nx] out of the box. To view it on your browser, clone the repository and run:

```bash
npm run dep-graph
```

A simplified graph looks like the following. It gives you insightful information for your mono repo and is especially helpful when multiple projects depend on each other.

### Nx Computation Cache

Nx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Visit [Nx Cloud](https://nx.app/) to learn more.
